## Introduction

This project was an important step in my journey to learn web development as it introduced me to the basics of HTML and CSS. I learned how to structure a webpage using HTML and how to style it using CSS. However, it wasn't easy, I faced many problems and challenges while working on this project.

**The final result of the project was this.**

## Project Approach

When I started working on this project, I knew that it would be a big undertaking, so I decided to break it down into smaller, manageable parts. I created a plan that divided the project into different sections such as :-

- Nav Section
- Hero Section
  - Right Section
  - Left Section

### Nav Section

First I began working on the navigation section of the project, I divided the section into three parts: the **LOGO**, the **Main Navigation links**, and the **Button** Div.

## Hero Section

I began working on the Hero Section. Divided the Hero section into two parts, the first with the Content like- Title, description & Button, and the Second div with the hero Image.
